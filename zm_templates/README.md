# Compiling and Debugging
To compile, run the `compile.py` script in your desired map's folder.

For debugging, you can use these commands, but must be ran separately:
```
loadmod "" 			// for unloading the map's mod
loadmod [mod_name] 	// for loading the map's mod
exec [mod_name] 	// each map will come with a config that runs the map with the correct gametype
```
